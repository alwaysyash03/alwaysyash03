Hiii, I’m Yash Kumar, a BTech Computer Science student. I’m interested in AI, machine learning, web development, and robotics.

I also enjoy public speaking, especially on leadership, confidence, and personal growth, and I like motivating people to work towards their goals.

I work on AI/ML projects, build web applications using Python, Django, HTML, and CSS, and actively participate in hackathons, conferences, and tech events. I’m currently learning German and aim to intern at BMW in Germany in the future.

Outside tech, I enjoy reading and staying updated with new innovations.
