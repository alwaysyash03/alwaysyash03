💬 I'm deeply passionate about:
- Speaking on *leadership* and *personal growth*
- Delivering *motivational talks* that inspire others to take charge of their future
- Empowering individuals to find their voice and *speak with confidence*

💻 On the tech side, I’m actively involved in:
- AI and machine learning projects
- Web development with Python, Django, HTML, and CSS
- Robotics and autonomous technology
- Conferences, hackathons, and competitions

🌱 I’m currently learning *German* and exploring new technologies to broaden my skills in the ever-evolving tech landscape. I also dream of interning at *BMW in Germany* and continuing my journey in leadership development and technology.

⚡️ When I'm not coding, you'll find me reading, learning about ongoing innovations in tech.

Feel free to reach out to collaborate on exciting projects or just have a chat!
